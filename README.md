Log A Tad
=========
Now a tad, later glad!
----------------------

1. Focuses on quick human generated logging of ... well, anything.
2. Focuses on flexible addition of data structure with minimal impact to 1.
3. Focuses on easy creation of log pages where Tads of a kind can be
viewed (and entered) together.
4. Focuses on easy creation of log books where log pages of a kind can be
organized together.
5. Of course, there is extensive tagging possible.

An entry into a tad log can be a simple matter of timestamping the push of a
button.  Details are filled in later, at a more convenient time and user
interface, if so needed.
